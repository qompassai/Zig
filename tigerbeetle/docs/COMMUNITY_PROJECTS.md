## Database Clients Made With ‚ù§Ô∏è By the Community

Third-party are not yet officially supported by TigerBeetle. But we do
our best to support them anyway!

Keep in mind that before our first release there will be frequent breaking
changes. We integration-test all first-party clients but third-party
clients may lag behind.

* [tigerbeetlex](https://github.com/rbino/tigerbeetlex): An Elixir client
* [tigerbeetle-cpp](https://github.com/kassane/tigerbeetle-cpp): A C++ client
* [tigerbeetle-rs](https://github.com/ZetaNumbers/tigerbeetle-rs): A Rust client

Need a client for Go, Java, Node.js, or .NET? We've got you covered
with [first-party
clients](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/tree/main/src/clients).
