# `get_account_transfers`

Fetch [`Transfer`](../transfer.md)s involving a given [`Account`](../account.md).

## Event

The account filter.
See [`AccountFilter`](../account-filter.md) for constraints.

## Result

- Return a (possibly empty) array of [`Transfer`](../transfer.md)s that match the filter.
- If any constraint is violated, return nothing.
- By default, `Transfer`s are sorted chronologically by `timestamp`. You can use the
  [`reversed`](../account-filter.md#flagsreversed) to change this.
- The result is always limited in size. If there are more results, you need to page through them
  using the `AccountFilter`'s [`timestamp_min`](../account-filter.md#timestamp_min) and/or
  [`timestamp_max`](../account-filter.md#timestamp_max).
