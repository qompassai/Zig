# Deploying on Linux

## systemd

TigerBeetle includes an example
[systemd unit](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/tree/main/tools/systemd/)
for use with Linux systems that use systemd. The unit is configured to start a
single-node cluster, so you may need to adjust it for other cluster
configurations.

See the [Quick Start](../quick-start.md) for an example of how to run a single-
vs multi-node cluster.
